Notes:
This is some notes on the process of Creating an automated board tester.
Sure, Desinging the thing sounds fun, but Im a newb, and there are whole companies that do this type of thing.
Those Companies are going to have questions, like: 
how many test points?
how big is the board?
Test Point Direction? Top, bottom, both...
Minimum Pitch to Pitch distance: (how close are the Test Points to eachother?)
what specific tests? (continutiy, ohms? RF? point to point connectivity?)
Test Point Pad diameter.



==== Design concepts ====
Pogo Pins:
  plunger + barrel + spring.
  Described as: Body, insulator matierial, spring, piston, tail.
  Piston disgns: Concave, pointed, round, crown, chisel, FLAT
  Different puston types have various purposes.
  Travel: longer piston travel can help with uneven boards / hand loaded test fixtures.
  spring length directly relates to internal restistance, and speed at which pins can be placed. (bounce), and resistive (pin to pin ) variance.

Some pogos are solderd into boards. ( better for small boards )
Others are mechaicaly placed in Jigs, and wired back to a connector. 

Conductors may be crimped, solderd, or screwed in. I guess that depends on what future serviceablity is going to be like.

Floating / Compliant Mounts :: Pogo pins are mounted in a plate, the plate rides on springs or elastomer. Alignment pins may be used to 
        keep the testing apparatus oriented properly relative to the PCB being tested. 
    This method is intended to compensate for board tolerence variation, 
        not to handle alignment.



=== Design Factors=====
Ampacity :: probably 2Amps or less. 
RF :: I dont know if we want to do RF tests.
We want repeatable board testing for the HPC.

Docking Method:: levered, pneumatic, or manual.



############ TESTS #######################
The Test Points and their descriptings are on page 1 of the schematic. 
OR See the Test Point Legend in this REPO:



Specific tests are not yet defined for Test and Measure.


=== Our Specs =====
min TP distance so far: TP131 to TP112 == 2.1mm
( I havn't found one lower yet. )

Dimensions mm :: 280 x 160

Desired Pogo Pin Piston design -> Flat
